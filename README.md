# Small-Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

Small Image classification using CIFAR10 dataset in tensorflow. We will use convolutional neural network for this image classification problem. First we will train a model using simple artificial neural network and then check how the performance looks like and then we will train a CNN and see how the model accuracy improves.
